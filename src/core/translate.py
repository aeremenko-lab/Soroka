"""Russian summarisation for non-Russian extracted content.

Used by ingest to attach a short Russian description to web/youtube
notes whose body is in another language. The summary helps the owner
recognise what a foreign-language link is about at a glance and boosts
recall on Russian queries (the summary is concatenated into the
embedding text alongside the original body).

The module is best-effort: any LLM/network failure returns ``None`` and
the caller proceeds without a summary. Ingest must never block on this.
